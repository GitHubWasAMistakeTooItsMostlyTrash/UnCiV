## What is UnCiV?

UnCiV started off as a modestly ambitious project with a limited number of achievable goals aimed at removing the game's bias and making it a more objective respresentation of history:
- To replace Greece with Macedonia and Austria with Hungary
- To replace Theodora, Wu Zetian, Isabella, Gandhi, Dido, Maria Theresa and Catherine with less unsympathetic and more representative historical leaders
- To add Assyria, Poland, Portugal, Brazil, kwaZulu, Indonesia, Shoshone and Venice from Brave New World
- To remove Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, Germany, France, England, Iroquois, Arabia, Songhai, Morocco, Ottomans, Korea and Siam
- To increase the availability of Oil, Aluminum and Uranium by about 50%


Within a matter of hours, however, the project had expanded exponentially to the overambitious aim of compiling existing mods to include any important civilizations that they added and all modifications to the uniques of civilization in UnCiV, with reckless disregard to balance.

As a result, the project currently seems to have become open-ended.

## To do


## To be decided

~~Who should lead Russia: 
Ivan the Terrible, Dmitry the Pious, Matvei Platov, Grigori Rasputin, Alexander Kolchak, Vladimir Putin ?~~ \

or should Irorquois be removed and Shoshone kept ?~~ \
Powhatan and Wampanoag instead of Iroquois and Shoshone
